This app will ultimately help users reduce food waste and teach them new recipes that they would not have known otherwise.

## Use-Cases
Most common:
Coming home after a busy work day, unable to order food or have any ideas of what to cook. The user can search for the ingredients they have in their homes and search them in the app, where they will be provided related recipes of the ingredient(s) they searched for.

Party Event:
Group of friends could pick out sticks, and the shortest one has to cook a meal for the entire group. The people who didnt get the short stick could use the app and put in as many and as polarizing ingredients as they want and the losing person has to select one of the recipes and cook a meal with it.

Lack of ingredients:
If there is no time to go grocery shopping and there are ingredients lying around, the user can search up a quick recipe for those ingredients.

Prevent food waste:
If there are ingredients about to reach expiry date, the user can use the app and search for those ingredients for recipes to prevent food waste and cook something delicious instead.

Cottage Trip:
If a family or group of friends are planning a cottage trip, they are only able to take limited ingredients due to limited storage. They can use this app to search for their favourite ingredients for recipes and plan their meals beforehand so when the time comes, they will not be confused and make meal decisions quickly.

## Work Distribution:
Each person will oversee and share tasks of the page design of their assigned tasks. As a group, we are still deciding between whether to use a database to store pre-made recipes and custom recipes or use an API along with a database for custom recipes. 

### Karan (991519115)
* Add basic create, read, update, delete operations for the recipes. If API is used, the create, update, delete options will be only for custom recipes. 
* Design of the page that will be required for these functions with Deep.

### Aydin (991521740)
* Implement search functionality using either keywords or tags attached to recipes.
* Implement working timed notifications that will remind users. 
* Task may be divided further if the workload is too high.
* Design of the page that will be required for these functions with Deep.

### Deep (991584445)
* Oversee the general layout and design of the app for the project with included inputs from Karan and Aydin.
* Implement and configure database/API tasks and calls and assist Aydin and Karan to use the features.
